The Story of Proelium<br/>
==========================<br/>
In the closing weeks of my 8th grade year, my friends and I created a small fighting game on index cards. Years later, I tried to bring this game to my mobile phone and I suceeded in creating a viable prototype.<br/> 

There was one major difference between my app and the card game: Instead of playing agaisnt another player, I had a bot opponent. The logic for this was first written in Java, then ported to Javascript. React Native was then used to allow an interface with the scripted game language. <br/>

This small game has stood the test of time. I recently recovered my first smartphone and found that the final build of Proelium was still joyfully playable. I resolve to bring this game from the React-Native on my old android 5 device to a react app generated by reactpy such that it can be launched from a python http server from my current Android device.<br/>
